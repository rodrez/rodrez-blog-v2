## What are trying to accomplish?

THhis excersize is to convert user input to an enum in Rust.
We will verify user input against the following keywords:

- Off
- Sleep
- Reboot
- Shutdown
- Hibernate

If the user enters one of the keywords, a message should be printed to the console indicating which action will be taken  
**Example:** If the user types in "shutdown" a message should display such as "shutting down"

## Step 1: Create the enum

We will create the enum to hold the keywords.

<CodeSnippet
  language="rust"
  code={`
enum Action {
    Off,
    Sleep,
    Reboot,
    Shutdown,
    Hibernate,
}
`}
/>

## Step 2: Create the function to print the message

Now we will create the function that takes the enum as an argument and prints the appropriate message.
Don't forget to borrow the enum in the argument.

<CodeSnippet
  language="rust"
  code={`
fn print_message(action: &Action) {
    match action {
        Action::Off => println!("Turning off"),
        Action::Sleep => println!("Sleeping"),
        Action::Reboot => println!("Rebooting"),
        Action::Shutdown => println!("Shutting down"),
        Action::Hibernate => println!("Hibernating"),
    }
}
`}
/>

## Step 3: Create an impl for the enum to convert the user input to the enum

Instead of creating another function for this conversion, we will create an impl block for the enum.

We can create the impl after the enum because the enum is defined before the impl, like so.

<CodeSnippet
  language="rust"
  code={`
impl Action {
    fn from(input: &str) -> Action {
        match input {
            "off" => Action::Off,
            "sleep" => Action::Sleep,
            "reboot" => Action::Reboot,
            "shutdown" => Action::Shutdown,
            "hibernate" => Action::Hibernate,
        }
    }
}
`}
/>

## Step 4: Getting the user input and printing the message

The last piece of the puzzle is to get the user input and print the message.
To make this work we are going to need the `std::io` module.

Although this module is out of the scope of this article, click [std::io::stdin](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/fn.stdin.html) to read more about it.

<CodeSnippet
  language="rust"
  code={`
fn main() {
    let input = read_input();
    let action = Action::from(input);
    print_message(&action);
}
`}
/>
