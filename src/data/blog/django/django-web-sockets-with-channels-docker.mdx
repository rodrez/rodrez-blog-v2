# Django Web Sockets with Channels & Docker

# Setting Channels in Django Settings

- It is important that if you are using Docker, keep in mind that we have to setup two env varibles:

`REDIS_HOST=redis`
`REDIS_PORT=6379`

Notice the host is just redis instead of 127.0.0.1, the reason for this is because,
although Redis is running, your python container isn't able to communicate with it;
this is because it's trying to connect to 127.0.0.1:6379, but from the container's perspective,
there's nothing running there.^[This answer was provided in SO by Saites. [Stack Overflow Question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59976480/docker-errno-111-connect-call-failed-127-0-0-1-6379#:~:text=22-,Try%20changing%20127.0.0.1%3A6379%20to%20redis%3A6379.,-Although%20Redis%20is)]
