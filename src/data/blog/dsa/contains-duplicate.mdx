## The prompt

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array,
and return false if every element is distinct.

## Examples

<BlogTable
  headers={['Example', 'Input', 'Output']}
  rows={[
    ['1', `[1,2,3,1]`, <span className="mark">true</span>],
    ['2', `[1,2,3,4]`, <span className="mark">false</span>],
    ['3', `[1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]`, <span className="mark">true</span>],
  ]}
/>

### Constraints

1 `<=` nums.length `<=` 105

-109 `<=` nums[i] `<=` 109

### Solution #1: (Worst)

<CodeSnippet
  code={`def naive_solution(nums: List[int]) -> bool:
    # Loops trough the list 
    for i in nums:
        # Loops through the list but starts at the \`i\` element of nums
        for j in nums[i:]:
            if i == j:
                return True
    return False`}
  language="python"
  showLineNumbers
  lineFocus={[]}
  addedLines={[]}
  removedLines={[]}
/>

Let's assume we have `nums = [1,2,3,1]`

1. The first loop selects the first element in this case \`1\`.

2. Next, the second loops starts after the first element selected
   in the first loop. In this case \`2\`

3. Then the conditional if statement compares the to numbers for equality.
4. If the numbers are equal True is returned, otherwise we repeat step 1 at the next element.

    "No new variable was assiged. Thus it's excellent memory wise. It's not consuming extra memory."

  }
  children={'O(n²)'}
/>

### Solution #2: (Not So Worst)

<CodeSnippet
  code={`def sorted_solution(nums: List[int]) -> bool:
    sorted_array = sorted(nums)
    for n in range(len(sorted_array)):
        if n < len(sorted_array)-1 and sorted_array[n] == sorted_array[n+1]:
            return True
    return False`}

  removedLines={[]}
/>

<span className="text-xl font-bold">How does it work?</span>

        1. The first thing we do is sort the list. Some programming languages, have array methods to perform
        sorting.

        2. After we sort the array/list, we need to check all elements
        using a loop and verifying the adjacent element.

        3. After the array is sorted it would become: `[1,1,2,3]`

        4. Next, the for loop would go through the first element.

        5. Additionally, we need a conditional if statement to compare
        the current element and the adjacent element to the left.

        6. If the elements are the same, then we return True,
        otherwise we continue the loop.

        7. If no elements are found to be duplicate we return False after the
        loop is done.

        Note: O(n log(n)) is slightly better than O²

<HoverMe meaning={'New variable was assiged. Thus it affects memory used.'} children={'O(1)'} />
<HoverMe meaning={'Logarithmic Time. '} children={'O(n²)'} />

### Solution #3: (Good)

<CodeSnippet
  code={`def set_solution(nums:List[int]) -> bool:
    hash_set = set()
    for n in nums:
        if n in hash_set: 
            return True
        # Else can be ignored but it's added for explicitness (easier to read imo)
        else:
            hash_set.add(n)
    return False
`}
  language="python"
  showLineNumbers
  lineFocus={[]}
  addedLines={[]}
  removedLines={[]}
/>

<span className="text-xl font-bold">How does it work?</span>

        1. First, we need to create a new set variable. This variable will hold a set.

        2. Then, we loop through the array.

        3. If the item is not in set, we added.

        4. Otherwise, the item is already in the set, so we can return True because a duplicate was found.

        5. If none of the items is duplicate we return false after the loop, since no duplicate were found.

  children={'O(n)'}
/>
<HoverMe
  meaning={
    'Linear Time. What this means is that it increases in proportion to the number of inputs.'
  }
  children={'O(n)'}
/>

### Solution #4: (Clever Pythonista)

<CodeSnippet
  code={`def clever_solution(nums: List[int]) -> bool:
    return len(set(nums)) != len(nums)`}
  language="python"
  showLineNumbers
  lineFocus={[]}
  addedLines={[]}
  removedLines={[]}
/>

<span className="text-xl font-bold">How does it work?</span>

        In the case of Python we can verify for duplicates by leveraging `set()`

        `set()` builds a collection of unordered <CoolText color="text-[#6b2cf5] dark:text-light-green">unique</CoolText> elements.

        Taking that in consideration we can simply compare the length of the original array,
        versus the length of the array that we converted to a set.

        Because `set()` drops duplicates, if the arrays are not the same length that means,
        there were duplicates.
