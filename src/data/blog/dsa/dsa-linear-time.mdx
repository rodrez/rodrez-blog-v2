# So what is linear time in Data Structures and Algorithms

Linear time, or O(n) time, refers to an algorithm or operation that takes a time proportional to the size of the input. In other words, if the size of the input is doubled, the time taken by the algorithm or operation will also be roughly doubled.

For example, consider an algorithm that processes a list of numbers. If the list has 10 numbers, the algorithm might take 1 second to run. If the list has 20 numbers, the algorithm might take 2 seconds to run. If the list has 100 numbers, the algorithm might take 10 seconds to run. In each case, the time taken by the algorithm is roughly proportional to the size of the input (i.e., the number of numbers in the list).

Linear time is generally considered to be efficient for algorithms that process small inputs, but can become impractical for very large inputs. For example, if an algorithm takes 1 second to process a list of 10 numbers, it might take 100 seconds to process a list of 1000 numbers. In this case, the algorithm would be considered to have a slow (linear) time complexity.

There are other time complexities that are faster than linear time, such as constant time (O(1)) and logarithmic time (O(log n)). There are also time complexities that are slower than linear time, such as quadratic time (O(n^2)) and exponential time (O(2^n)).
