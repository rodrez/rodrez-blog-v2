## What is Bubblesort?

Bubblesort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by running two loops and comparing each pair of adjacent elements.
If the first element is greater than the second element, then the two elements are swapped.
This process is repeated until the array is sorted.

## How does it work?

Let's take for exmaple the following array: `[5, 3, 1, 2, 4]`

The first loop will look something like this:

<CodeSnippet 
  code={`array = [5, 3, 1, 2, 4]

for i in range(0, len(array)):
for j in range(0, len(array) - i - 1):
if array[j] > array[j + 1]:
array[j], array[j + 1] = array[j + 1], array[j]
`}

language="python"
showLineNumbers
lineFocus={[]}
addedLines={[]}
removedLines={[]}
/>
